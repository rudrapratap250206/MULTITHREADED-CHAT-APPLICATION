AS WE KNOW THAT IN JAVA TO DO CLIENT SERVER CHAT  HAVE A CLASS NAMED CHAT .SO WE CREATED AN OBJECT FROM A CLASS NAME CHAT .AS CLIENT WANT TO ACCESS THE SERVER, SO THE SERVER WILL TRY TO MAKE AN OBJECT FOR CLIENT NAMED AS SERVER SOCKET. THERE ARE SOME SOCKETS IN SERVER THAT COMMUNICATE VIA SERVER SOCKET.AND THEN CLIENT ESTABLISH CONNECTION WITH SERVER SOCKET. FOR THAT CLIENT NEEDS TO KNOW THE ADDRESS OF THE SERVER AND THE PORT NUMBER OF THE SERVER. THEN CLIENT CREATES IT'S OWN SOCKET THAT COMMUNICATE WITH SERVER SOCKET. THEN SERVER SOCKET COMMUNICATES WITH IT'S INTERNAL SOCKET APPLICATION. FIRSTLY SERVER HAS TO INSTANTIATE SERVER SOCKET OBJECT WITH SPECIFIED PORT NUMBER. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AS CLIENT CONNECTS WITH THE SOCKET OBJECT USING PORT NUMBER OF SERVER SOCKET.THEN SERVER INVOKES ACCEPT METHOD OF THE SERVER SOCKET CLASS. IT TAKES PLACE UNTIL CLIENT CREATES SOCKET OBJECT OR CLIENT TRIES TO ESTABLISH CONNECTION WITH SERVER SOCKET OBJECT. THEN CLIENT CREATE SOCKET OBJECT WITH TWO INFORMATIONS WITH SERVER NAME AND PORT NUMBER. THEN CONNECT IT TO CLIENTS PLACE.
